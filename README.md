# Building A Sec Monitoring Environment

<h2>Scenario</h2>
This week, we used Splunk to build a custom security monitoring environment for a fictional organization, tested that environment against simulated attacks, and presented our monitoring environment to the class.

As we worked on the project, we completed review questions and a slides presentation. These documents are my project deliverables.

Although we worked on this project in a group, deliverables were submitted individually.
